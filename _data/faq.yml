  - q: How does the 14-day free trial work?
    a: Once you sign-up to 7shifts, you immediately get access to all features in 7shifts for 14 days. If you have any questions, we have fast support that will be happy to give you a hand. Also, we don’t require a credit card to start the trial. You get to test out 7shifts without any strings attached.
  - q: What happens at the end of the trial?
    a: To continue to have access to your 7shifts account, you will be asked to enter your credit card information and select your subscription plan. Once that is done, your trial account will become your permanent account. If you decide not to continue at the end of your 14-day trial, your account will expire.
